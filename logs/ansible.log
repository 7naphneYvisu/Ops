ERROR 2019-04-17 17:55:00 run_playbook 执行/testops/Ops/media/playbook/2018/12/18/tomcat.yml失败，原因: Syntax Error while loading YAML.


The error appears to have been in '/usr/share/ansible/roles/tomcat/tasks/main.yml': line 4, column 81, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

  unarchive:
    src: "http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-{{ tomcat_version|slice:"0" }}/v{{ tomcat_version }}/bin/apache-tomcat-{{ tomcat_version }}.tar.gz"
                                                                                ^ here
We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
missing quotes.  Always quote template expression brackets when they
start a value. For instance:

    with_items:
      - {{ foo }}

Should be written as:

    with_items:
      - "{{ foo }}"

exception type: <class 'yaml.parser.ParserError'>
exception: while parsing a block mapping
  in "<unicode string>", line 4, column 5
did not find expected key
  in "<unicode string>", line 4, column 81
